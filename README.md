# MotMagArt1
The "MotMagArt1" repository includes MATLAB code for three functions - `CompMagMatrix`, `CompMagMatGen`, and `CompElemMag` - used to perform Motion Magnification on synthetic grayscale images. 
It also contains two folders: "Test Images", which provides images for testing the magnification procedure, and "Videos", which holds three videos â€“ the original input, the magnified result, 
and a comparison video displaying both input and magnified videos side-by-side.
